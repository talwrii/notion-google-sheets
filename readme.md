# notion-google-sheets
Library and functions to interact with notion from the online browser [google sheets](https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro) and [google sheets app scripts](https://script.google.com).

## Granting access
Notion access is granted at the *database* level. 
See [notion docs](https://www.notion.so/help/create-integrations-with-the-notion-api) to create an integration.

## Usage

Copy-and-paste notiong.gs into your sheets file. There is a mechanism to support libraries in google sheets, this is not supported yet.

## Feature completeness
This library is incomplete, however it shouldn't be too hard to write your own call if you have coding knowledge. See the [official REST api documentation](https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro).


## Alternatives and prior work
* Notion is proprietary and  closed-source with all the risks that come with it. 
* There are many clients in other languages.
* [This blog post](https://max-brawer.medium.com/update-notion-databases-from-a-google-sheet-with-apps-script-c9a95df74c97) discusses using notion from sheets.
